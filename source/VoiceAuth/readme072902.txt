On VoiceAuth Decision Screen

Past logging information - Grid on left

Incorrectly displays OP DECLINED message. Instead shows original R# reason.
1. It is SPSLog

This has wortked this wasy for perhaps 2 years since Rick made a 
change of some sort related to R# messages


It is assumed that Rick needs to fix it, but locating it on the Win
(Jack's) system is considered the start.

logrec.Message probably holds the data


Date     Merch      Amt         Chknum  BV  Response ID

Seems like IDC_ACT1RC is the data member
#defined in DecisionDialog.rh




In IPC message
00-19 Ricks messages
20 - 99 are Jack's


Output Code - In 'A' audit record (326 characters), positions 135, 135 
are 2 character code
00 - apv - verification only
01 - decline
20-39 rule violations
  21-31 call ctrs
40-49 bad checks
50-79 keying errors
80-89 apvls 
90-99 more data required

if Audit file has msg 50-59,
it's just not passed to Jack, nor TID NOT FOUND


In DecisionDialog.cpp
ActRows.RC - field, not file
  @40  created @40
  @424 Populated -  ActRows[Row].IDS->Transfer(Buf,tdSetData);
    Transfer(*tEdit) in IPCTransfer.h
  @452 - .Rcode string set from RcodeInfo

#ifndef __RCODEINFO_H
#define __RCODEINFO_H

class RcodeInfo
 {
  public:
  char* rcodeText(int rcode);
  bool IsKenwoodRcode(int rc) { return (rc>=1 && rc<=20); };
  bool IsApprovalRcode(int rc) { return (rc>=80 && rc<=89); };
  bool IsDeclineRcode(int rc) { return (rc>=21 && rc<=28); };
  bool IsErrorRcode(int rc) { return ! IsApprovalRcode(rc) &&
                                     ! IsDeclineRcode(rc); };
 };
#endif

classlib\RCodeInfo.cpp - strings are initialized

At position 190 in Record is ?DeliveryMethod
  O - Operator
  N - Network
..So is this data available???

IPCMessage& replyMsg; is declared in DecisionDialog.h

DecisionDialog.cpp 
@484 displayActivity() calls
@396 void DecisionDialog::formatActivityRow(int Row,int Index)
.. So how did the data get into into Act to get to the ActRows[] Edits?? 
Act is an ACTIVITY record @100 decisionDialog.h


File Name - DTA..101  .. or whatever cluster number
transports all the records from UNIX to NT (including Audit)

ACTIVITY is defined in include\kwrec.h as a translation from an 
AUDIT. An AUDIT has a DeliveryMethod in it, so need to add
DeliveryMethod to ACTIVITY... or key it into the RCode
Translation is done in ... 


########   Final Resolution
I changed two lines in rcodesinfo.cpp
Line 2  - "KENWOOD NEG 01" became "DECL FORCED" 
Line 29 - "UNDEFINED 29" became "DECL NEGATIVE" 

Rick adjusted his code to trigger message 29
