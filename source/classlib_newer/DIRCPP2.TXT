~    2. SpaceBar toggles the LIST UP and DOWN.
~    2. Treats first character of each String as a selection Hot Key
~    3. Supports Clear function (Windows doesn't allow it for Drop
~         Down List Boxes for some unknown reason).

~  This is a Derived class of DBManRecord to handle the Data
~  Requirements Record.

 DBManRec.cpp           4,071
~  Source file for implementation of DBManRecord (Base Class)
~  This is the bass class from which all of the other DBManager
~  records are derived. It provides some default behavior but most
~  of the member functions are intended to be overriden in the
~  derived class.

~  Source file for implementation of DialogControlManager (IPCTransfer)
~  This is a derived class of IPCTranser. It's a container/handler
~  for Dialog Controls. It provides a way
~  of linking fields directly to controls via IPCMessage Field numbers.
~  It also provides the ability to associate Message Numbers with
~  the fields.
~  This object is used primarily by the Voice Authorization program
~  to move data back and forth from the IPCMessage to a Window and
~  it also updates the Message Window as control focus changes.

 DecimalValidator.cpp   1,885
~  Source file for implementation of DecimalValidator (TValidator)
~  A validator for decimal entry. Requires all numerics and allows
~  only one decimal point. Insures no more than max number of characters
~  provided by caller to the right and left of the decimal points.

 EditStateCodes.cpp     8,158
~  Source file for implementation of EditStateCodes (TEdit).
~  Provide an Edit Control with a popup list of state codes. The
~  operator types the first character of the state and a list pops
~  up to help with the second character (it's actually a menu but
~  the user doesn't select from it).

 EditUns.cpp            3,607
~  Source file for implementation of TEditUns (PlainEdit).
~  This is a derived class of Tedit (PlainEdit) to support Unsigned
~  number conversions To/From Edit Controls (provides polymorphic
~  member functions for ease of use). See the UnsNum module
~  in the Lib directory for a description of Unsigned Numbers.
~
~  NOTE: See EditVar. It may be more useful than this. It does
~  the transferring for you automatically.

 EditVar.cpp           10,416
~  Source file for implementation of TEditVar::TEditVar (PlainEdit).
~  Makes a direct connection between a TEdit and a Variable, moving
~  it automatically from the Control to the Variable when the Control
~  value is changed.
~  Displays the Variable value when the TEdit is created. After that
~  you have to call the Display function to re-display the variable.
~  Call the transfer function to cause the control value to be moved
~  immediately to the variable.
~  Supports all standard data types and includes these Options:
~
~   EVOPT_ZEROISNULL  - Treat Zero as the NULL Value. Display a
~                       blank field instead of zero. If a field is
~                       blank, set it's variable to zero.
~   EVOPT_MAXISNULL   - Treat Max value for the unsigned type as NULL,
~                       (UINT_MAX,USHRT_MAX,UCHAR_MAX).
~   EVOPT_ZEROFILL    - Zero fill values to TextLimit when displayed.

 FieldValidation.cpp   20,058
~  Source file for implementation of FieldValidation.
~  These are member functions of the CheckAuth object related to
~  the validation of fields. It uses the Data Requirements record
~  to check for missing fields and contains validation routines for
~  fields that are required.

 IPCTransfer.cpp        4,914
~  Source file for implementation of IPCTransfer (Base Class)
~  Provides a mechanism for transferring date to/from Window Controls
~  and IPCMessage Fields.

 LevelSelect.cpp        4,179
~  Source file for implementation of TLevelSelect (TEdit).
~  This is an Edit control that acts like a Button. When you click it,
~  it changes values. It's used by SPSMANAGER to handle the Rule
~  Enablers.

 MerchantRec.cpp        6,586
~  Source file for implementation of MerchantRec (DBManRecord)
~  This is a Derived class of DBManRecord to handle the Merchant Record.

 msgsize.cpp            6,957
  some sort of field test app

 MsgWin.cpp            10,941
~  Source file for implementation of TMsgWin (TDialog).

 PlainEdit.cpp          1,390
~  Source file for implementation of PlainEdit::PlainEdit (TEdit).
~  This is simply a TEdit that doesn't have a pop up menu (the right
~  mouse click is ignored. There was probably a better way of doing this
~  but I'll be damned if I could figure it out.

 PositiveRules.cpp      2,527
~  Source file for implementation of PositiveRules (DBManRecord)
~  This is a Derived class of DBManRecord to handle the Positive File
~  Rules Record.

 PosResponse.cpp        1,841
~  Source file for implementation of PosResponse   (DBManRecord)
~  This is a Derived class of DBManRecord to handle the POS Response
~  Record.

 productclasslist.cpp   8,182
~  Source file for implementation of ProductClassList (StringList)
~  This is a Derived class of StringList to handle the Product Code
~  List.

 rcodeinfo.cpp          2,804
~  Source file for implementation of RcodeInfo
~  Encapsulates information about SPS response codes.
~  Most of the info is inline (see the header).

 RecSize.cpp            4,108
  has main() - seems to be test code?

 Scoring.cpp            7,070
~  Source file for implementation of Check Auth
~  This is the Transaction scoring member function of the CheckAuth object.

 StringDB.cpp           7,411
~  Source file for implementation of StringDB (TFile).
~  Manages a String Database in a disk file. It's used by Voice
~  Authorizations to handle the Messages for the Message Window.

 stringlist.cpp        14,615
~  Source file for implementation of StringList (Base Class)
~  This is a general purpose List Handler class. It provides member
~  functions for fetching the list from a variety of sources, including
~  files and database servers. It also provides member functions for
~  managing the list.
~  List items are simply null-terminated Text Strings.

 StringTreeList.cpp     5,131
~  Source file for implementation of StringTreeList (StringList)
~  This is a Derived class of StringList to provide a tree structured
~  list. It is used by the SPS Manager database to handle the Auth
~  Rules List.
~  List items are preceded either by a P (Parent) or a C (Child)
