  IPolyString interface

  PolyString's represent a string that once set, never changes in content
  during its lifetime. Conversions are provided on demand between 'C', Pascal, 
  and BSTR style strings. 

  !!!!  
  NOTE: CONVERSIONS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, CURRENTLY, ONLY 'C' STRING SUPPORT
  IS HOOKED UP!
  
  THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A PATCH TO FIX THIS SOON.
  !!!!
    
  Conversions of a particular string are never performed more than once, 
  since they are kept in memory until the PolyString is released by all 
  clients.

  If a function returns a PolyString, the caller of the function is responsible
  for releasing the PolyString when finished with it.

  If you are passing a PolyString as an argument to a function, the receiver
  of the PolyString is responsible for Releasing it sometime after receiving
  it. 

  If you return a PolyString from your function or pass a PolyString to a 
  function and aren't finished with the string, remember to bump up the 
  reference count and release it when you are finished with it.
