  ScriptServer Interface 
  Using this interface you can install scripts, call functions written in
  script (yours or the ide's) and have access to the ide's scriptable
  class objects.

// Warning! Do not attempt to issue any script commands in anything but the 
// main UI thread. Currently, the addon wrapper dll does not protect you from
// doing this, but script methods will generally leave the IDE in a 
// crippled state when run from another thread. 
// 
// The most common place that  you would be tempted to do this is if you have
// installed a translator tool that has registered an IToolImplementor 
// interface. If the user has put the IDE in async mode, your 
// IToolImplementor::Execute() method will be called in a seperate make thread.
// Do not try to call through the IScriptServer from within this thread.

  // WARNING: Avoid running script commands when inside a transfer tool 
  // callback, since this will be in a different thread if the user
  // has selected selects Async mode, and the script engine doesn't 
  // handle this properly yet. The end result of violating this rule
  // is unpredictable, but usually fatal in one way or another.
